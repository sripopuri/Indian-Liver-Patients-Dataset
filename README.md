# Indian-Liver-Patients-Dataset

This repository consists of the code that I wrote inorder to do the classification problem on Liver Patients.
This dataset is taken from Kaggle and I have used Logistic regression, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors.

There are conclusions written in the end, this is the version of the code which I have written on 27th February 2018.
As mentioned in the code I would like to give next versions of analysis for this problem.

Soon there will be a final version of this problem.
This code is posted as a kernel in the Kaggle platform as well. Please feel free to comment!
